                Carthage was a powerful and influential Phoenician city-state founded in the 9th century BC on the coast of present-day Tunisia. 
                Renowned for its strategic location and exceptional maritime capabilities, Carthage became a dominant force in the Mediterranean region.
                Its advanced trade networks, innovative shipbuilding, and thriving economy made it a key player in ancient history. However, Carthage is perhaps most famous for its series of conflicts with Rome, known as the Punic Wars, which ultimately led to its destruction in 146 BC. Despite its fall, Carthage’s legacy 
                as a center of culture, commerce, and military power remains significant in the annals of history.            </p>
